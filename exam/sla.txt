[coverage]
Any git repos (including this one) would be pulled daily to the backup
servers in order to preserve configuration data (DNS zones, initial setup,
service configurations). The git protocol provides the needed integrity 
checks and version history.

Alongside code, data stored in both the MySQL and InfluxDB databases would
be dumped daily for backups. This may contain private user data and should be
handled in compliance with data protection regulations.

Binary content (audiovisual), user-submitted or otherwise, would also have to
be stored.

[frequency]
Backups would be performed daily (unless the boss complains), across all types
of data.

[retention]
The backups would be preserved for a month.
Incremental backups would be used, with full backups sometime between Sunday
and Monday night during periods with low traffic.

[verification]
Scripted testing of backups would be implemented and performed after each
full backup.
